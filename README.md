# SQL Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my ability to write efficient and insightful SQL queries to solve real-world business problems. These projects demonstrate intermediate to advanced SQL skills using PostgreSQL.

## Projects

### 1. Sales Data Analysis
**Goal**: Analyze product sales across regions to identify top-performing products.  
**Techniques Used**: CTEs, `JOIN`s, aggregation, window functions (`RANK()`).  
**Outcome**: Identified regional performance trends and seasonal variation.

---

### 2.  Customer Retention Metrics
**Goal**: Calculate churn rate and retention cohorts.  
**Techniques Used**: `CASE WHEN`, time filtering, subqueries, window functions.  
**Outcome**: Discovered customer lifecycle patterns and retention drop-off points.

---

### 3.  Marketing Campaign Performance
**Goal**: Measure the impact of targeted marketing campaigns on sales.  
**Techniques Used**: Pre/post analysis, control vs. test groups, explicit type casting for clean metrics.  
**Outcome**: Quantified ROI and informed reallocation of marketing spend.

### 4.  Inventory Optimization
**Goal**: Improve asset tracking and reduce shrinkage in high-value inventory.  
**Techniques Used**: Multi-table joins, nested queries, resolving ambiguous fields.  
**Outcome**: Streamlined reconciliation process and improved inventory accuracy.

##  Key Skills Demonstrated

- ✅ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- ✅ Window Functions: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`
- ✅ Conditional Logic: `CASE WHEN`
- ✅ Subqueries and Nested SELECTs
- ✅ Data Type Casting (`::numeric`, `::float`)
- ✅ Debugging: Resolving ambiguous column errors and function mismatches
